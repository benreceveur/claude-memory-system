# Test-First Change Skill

## Description
Implements Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow: write failing tests first, implement code, refactor.

## When to Use
- New feature development
- Bug fixing with test reproduction
- Refactoring with safety net
- API design through tests

## TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions/classes
- **Integration Tests**: Module interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full user workflows
- **Regression Tests**: Bug prevention

## Best Practices
- Write tests before code
- One test at a time
- Keep tests simple
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Aim for >80% coverage
- Fast test execution

## Quality Checklist
- ✅ Test written first
- ✅ Test fails initially
- ✅ Code makes test pass
- ✅ Code refactored
- ✅ All tests still pass
- ✅ Coverage maintained/improved
